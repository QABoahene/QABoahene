# Adu Boahene Q. - Data Scientist
I transitioned from Mechanical ENgineering to Data Science

Currently building up my skills in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
I believe in the technologies of data science to give us the ability to further improve the quality of living in almost all aspects. I am always looking for opportunities to merge my mechanical engineering and data science backgrounds.
