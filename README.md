# Adu Boahene Q. - Mechanical Engineer turned Data Professional
## My Journey
I started my academic journey with a keen interest in engineeing and technology which led me to study BSc. Mechanical Engineering. I spent a year after my undergraduate degree as an Operations Engineer which introduced me to problem solving from a data perspective. 
Digging deeper, a Master's degree in Data Science made sense to me which led to my next step in my academic journey pursuing MSc. Data Science and Computational Intelligence (2019 - 2020).

## Data Profession Journey
I started off my first data job as a Graduate Data Scientist (2020 - 2021). Skills and projects throughout this portion of my career and academics are reflected in the skills session below. 
Currently, I have transitioned into a Business Intelligence Engineering role (2021 - Present). I see this as an opportunity to build up my data skills to cover some BI background as well as utilising my data science skills in my position.
